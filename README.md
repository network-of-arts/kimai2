## Introduction

This is the _reloaded_ version of the open source timetracker Kimai.
It is built from scratch and doesn't share any source code with its [predecessor](http://www.kimai.org). 
But it adapts the same ideas and a clean & simple UI for your time-tracking experience.

By now it is in an almost-stable development phase, usable and with most advanced features from Kimai 1.
You can even [import your data](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/migration-v1.html) and start testing and using it today.

Kimai is a [multi-language application](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/translations.html) and already translated to english, german, italian, french, spanish, russian, arabic, hungarian, portuguese (brazilian), swedish and japanese.

### Updating Kimai

Read the following documentations before you start your upgrade:

- The [update documentation](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/updates.html)
- The version specific [UPGRADING guide](UPGRADING.md)
- The [release information](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases)

## Roadmap and releases

You can see a rough development roadmap in the [Milestones](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/milestones) sections.
It is open for changes and input from the community, your [ideas and questions](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues) are welcome!

> Kimai 2 uses a rolling release concept for delivering updates.
> You can upgrade Kimai at any time, you don't need to wait for the next official release. Read the [upgrade docs](UPGRADING.md) first!

Release versions will be created on a regular base (approx. 1 per month) and you can use these tags if you are familiar with Git, 
but we cannot provide support for any specific version (especially older ones).
Every code change, whether it's a new feature or a bug fix, will be done on the master branch. 
I have to do it this way, as I develop Kimai in my free time and want to put most
effort into the software instead of backporting changes for old versions. 

## Plugins for Kimai 2

Kimai 2 was built on top of the Symfony framework and can be extended in various ways:

- Users looking for existing plugins go to our [plugin marketplace](https://www.kimai.org/store/)
